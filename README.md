Browser builds tree-like structure (branch like structure with opening and closing tag)

HTML - HyperText Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.

DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.

HTML basic word is tag and browser turns it into a tree using DOM.

Basic HTML structure:
```html
<tag>
  content
<\tag>
```
Each tag has a type (paragraph, image, etc.) and can have attributes (e.g.) class) with values

To define the style you use CSS.
Also circle is a rectangular box, defined via border radius in CSS file.

boxes -> <div>-tag.
